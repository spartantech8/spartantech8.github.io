                <p> GAME DEMO- This game demo a was part of a 4 day coding challenge in which I was tasked to use a language 
                    I had never previously used to create and present a project at the end of the allotted time. 
                    This game was created using C# as well as Unity. Having never used a gaming engine nor C# 
                    at the time, this project provided a thrilling challenge given its time constraint, 
                    and became one of my favorite learning experiences to date.

                <p>ALCATRAZ- Alcatraz was designed to provide web developers a secure authentication and user management system for their web
                    applications. The goal of Alcatraz was to implement a service that replicated some key features of AWS Cognito, but that
                    does so in a manner that is more user friendly and time efficient for small, independent companies. Alcatraz oversees user
                    management features such as sign-up, sign-in and access control so developers can focus on other key components and features of 
                    the web and mobile applications they are tasked with designing.

                argument that the ideal vacation certainly varies person to person. Paradise Tailored

                person's idea of paradise. Through a list of weighted survey questions, we match you with 
                the vacation most fitted to your wants/needs.
